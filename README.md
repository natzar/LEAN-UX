#LEAN UX NOTES

Notes About Lean method applied to UX.


Problem Statement Template
--------
1. The current goals of the product or system
2. The problem the business stakeholder wants addressed
3. An explicit request for improvement that doesn't dictate a specific solution

Template:

>[Our Service/product] was designed to achieve [these goals]. The product/service isn't metting [these goals], which is causing [this side  effect] to our biz. How might we improve [service/product] so that our customers are more successfull based on [these measurable criteria]


Assumptions
-------
A hihg level declaration of what we believe to be true

#### Business Assumptions
1. I believe my customers have a need to ________
2. These needs can be solved with ________
3. The #1 Value a customer wants to get out of my service is _____
4. My initials customers are (or will be)
5. The customer can also get these additional benefits ___
6. I will acquire the majority of my customers thorugh _______
7. I will make money by ______
8. My primary competition in the market will be _____
9. We will beat them due to ____
10. My biggest product risk is ____
11. We will solve this through ______
12. What others assumptions do we have that, if proven false, will cause our business/project to fail?
 

####User Assumptions
1. Who is the user?
2. Where does our product fit in his life or work?
3. What problems does our product solve?
4. when and how is our product used?
5. what features are important?
6. How should our product look and behave?


Hypotheses
-------
More granular descriptions of our assumptions that target specific areas of our product or workflow for experimentation

>We believe [this statement is true] We will know we're[right/wrong] when we see the following feedback from the market: [qualitative feedback] and/or [quantitative feedback]Â and/or [key performance indicator change]

###Smaller parts example:
We believe that
>[doing this/building this feature/creating this experience] for [these people/personas] will achieve [this outcome] We will know this is true when we see [this market feedback, quantitative measure, or qualitative insight]


Outcomes
-------
The Signal we seek from the market to help us validate or invalidate our hypotheses.

Personas
-------
Models of the people for whom we believe we are solving a problem


* NAME, AGE, LOCATION, NICKNAME
* Behavioral demographic information (ex. 2 kids, marrieda, values time/family...(
* PAIN POINTS and needs.
* Potential solutions
 

Features
-------
The product changes or improvements we believe will drive the outcomes we seek

## The Seven Stages of Action as Design Aids
* **Visibility** By looking the user can tell the state of the device and the alternatives for action
* **Good conceptual model** Results in a consisten system image
* Good mappings. It is easy to determine the relationships between actions and results
* **Feedback** the user receives full and continuous feedback about the results of actions


The specific actions bridge the gap between what we would like to have done (our goals and intentions) and all possible physical actions.
There we have it, seven stages of action: one for goals, three for execution, and three for evaluation.
* Forming the goal
* Forming the intention
* Specifying an action
* Executing the action
* Perceiving the state of the world
* Interpreting the state of the world
* Evaluating the Outcome

### Using the Seven stages to ask Design Questions
**How Easily Can One:**

* Determine the function of the device/product?
* Tell what Actions are possible?
* Tell if system is in desired state?
* Determine Mapping from intention to Physical movement?
* Determine Mapping from System State to interpretation?
* Perform the action?
* Tell what state the system is in?



What to include in a MVP or prototype
--------
* What I am trying to learn?
* What are the main signals I need from the market to validate my hypotheses
* Are there any other signals I can test for that will serve as indicators for my main signal?
* What's the faster way for me to find this information?
